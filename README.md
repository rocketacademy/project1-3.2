## Introduction
Wordle+ is a Wordle and trivia quiz mashup for people who enjoy picking up general knowledge while having fun ðŸ¥³ Currently, the app supports a question bank of 30 trivia questions. In the future, themed games may be created with the objective of educating users on specific topics such as finance. As an example, a CPF-version (_CPF stands for Central Provident Fund_) of Wordle+ will help young adults to learn more about Singapore's mandatory savings and pension plan.

Wordle+ is built with React, TailwindCSS, Vite and Framer Motion.
